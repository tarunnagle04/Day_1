    <h2>1) Difference between div and span ?</h2>
    <h2>
      In HTML, the only difference between class and ID is that IDs are unique and each element can
      have only one ID. On the otherhand classes are not unique we can use same class on multiple
      elements.
      <ul>
        <li>ID's: Each page can have only one element with that ID.</li>
        <li>CLASS: You can use multiple classes on the same element.</li>
      </ul>
    </h2>

    <br />
    <h2>2) Difference between class and IDs?</h2>
    <h2>
      &lt div &gt tag stands for division tag and it is block-level element means it is bound to
      take the whole width of the screen. &lt span &gt tag is an inline element means it only takes
      the space that is required for it. It is used for grouping inline elements in the HTML
      documents. &lt div &gt should be used to wrap sections of a document, while spans should be
      used to wrap small portions of text, images, etc.
    </h2>

    <br />
    <h2>3)What are self-closing tags?</h2>
    <h2>
      In HTML , A self-closing tag is a type of tag that need not to be closed by closing tag, which
      means there is no separate closing tag for it as &lt /tag &gt. Elements that don't have any
      content are called empty elements. &lt br &gt is an empty element without a closing tag (the
      &lt br &gt tag defines a line break). Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like
      this: &lt br &gt. Example: &lt img &gt , &lt input &gt , &lt br &gt .
    </h2>

    <br />
    <h2>4) How many types of heading tags are there? How to decide which to use where?</h2>
    <h2>
      Heading tags are titles or subtitles that we want to display on our webpage. There are six
      levels of heading tags are there in HTML.
    </h2>

    <br />
    <h2>5) Difference between block and inline?</h2>
    <h2>
      A block element always begins on a new line and extends to left and right, and it takes the
      full width available on the webpage. Browsers automatically add some space(margin) before and
      after element. Examples of block elements are &lt div &gt, &lt p &gt, &lt h1 &gt to &lt h6
      &gt, &lt table &gt and &lt form &gt etc. An inline element does not begin on a new line. It
      only takes the space that is necessary for it. Examples of inline elements are &lt a &gt, &lt
      span &gt, &lt img &gt, &lt input &gt, &lt label &gt etc.
    </h2>

    <br />
    <h2>6) Difference between &lt em &gt and &lt strong &gt?</h2>
    <h2>
      The &lt strong &gt and &lt em &gt tags are used for emphasizing parts of a text. The &lt
      strong &gt tag should be used to indicate strong importance, or urgency, like to indicate key
      phrases in a text for someone skimming it. The &lt em &gt tag should be used to represent
      stress emphasis, like when you'd read the emphasized text in a different tone of voice. Both
      tags can be used together, where it makes sense.
    </h2>

    <br />
    <h2>7) What are Attributes?</h2>
    <h2>
      In HTML, Attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements
      and are the modifiers of HTML element. Attributes should be written in lowercase only as they
      are case sensitive. It should always be applied with its name and value pair. It should always
      be applied with the start tag, we can add multiple attributes to an element by giving space
      between two attributes.
